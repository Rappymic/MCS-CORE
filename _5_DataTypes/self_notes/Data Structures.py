"""
Data Structure
____________________
1. List --- []
    - mutable
    - ability to form nested list
    - generated again and again during interpretation
    - slower than tuples
    - each element has index
    - index starts fom left from 0

2. Tuples --- ()
    - immutable
    - faster than list
    - defined only one time
    - similar access as list

3. Dictionary --- {key: value}
    - key value pairs
    - Linked data can be stored
    - nestation supported
    - value can be accessed with key identity

4. Sets --- {}
    - just behaves like mathematical sets
    - values can not repeated
    - unordered
    - sets doesn't have index
