"""
Seven Operators
-------------------

-   Arithmetic Operators +,-,/,//,%,**

-   Boolean Operators--- TRUE OR FALSE

-   Bitwise Operators--- ^,&,|,~, <<, >>

-   Identity Operators--- IS, IS NOT

-   Membership Operators--- IN, NOT IN

-   Assignment Operators--- =,+=

-   Logical Operators--- AND, OR, NOT

-   Comparison Operator -- ==,



Bitwise works with binary
---------------------------
~ complement of number
    invert binary number

& performs binary and

| binary or

^ binary XOR

<< binary shift the digit left(gaining bits)

>> binary right shift (losing bits)
