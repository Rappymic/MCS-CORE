1) What is Python? What are the benefits of using Python?
Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasises code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
